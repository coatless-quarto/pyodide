# RevealJS Demo

The RevealJS demo uses an external extension called `{quarto-countdown}`.
In addition to installing the `{quarto-pyodide}` extension, you must also install the `countdown` shortcode extension.

You can do this by running in your Quarto Project:

```sh
# Install `quarto-countdown`
quarto add gadenbuie/countdown/quarto

# Install `quarto-pyodide`
quarto add coatless-quarto/pyodide
```
